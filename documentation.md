  * AR Method: Group
  * Description: Returns an array of unique objects based on whatever attribute you have passed it.  
  * Example: In a scenario where there are many users named Chase, and many users named Bob, Users.group(:name) will return [#<User id: 1, name: bob, state: Texas> #<User id:2, name:Chase, state: Texas>].  
  * Anything else?: Group is almost always follwed by a .count.   I THINK this is because grouping them all together isn't very useful unless we are trying to find the number of each identical attribute that exists.
